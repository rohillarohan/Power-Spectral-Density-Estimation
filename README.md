# Power-Spectral-Density-Estimation

The goal of this project is to find the spectral estimates of a colored noise using different estimation methods such as 
- Periodogram 
- Blackman-Tukey Mehtod 
- Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) Method 
- Welch's Method 
- Multi-Taper Method and to compare all these methods.

We start off by generating a colored noise by applying a filter to a unit variance white Gaussian noise. Then we use above mentioned algorithms to find the spectral estimates of this colored noise.
